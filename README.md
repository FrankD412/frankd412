## About Me

I’m a Software Engineer and Architect/Designer by education with practical experience from both the areas of Computer Architecture and HPC. Through the use of simulation during my various experiences, I’ve come to appreciate the complexities of developing generalized workflow automation in the computational sciences. My experiences instilled me with a passion for making high performance resources more accessible and useful to computational scientists. I strive to make computational science more reproducible and documentable

## Philosophy

**Motto**: *If it's not broken, break it and make it better.*

I love to build tools that users not only trust, but that allows them to more productively focus on their own work; however, simply delivering a tool is not enough. Tools need to outlive singular projects requiring iterative design, modular components, and a clear vision for the future. I thrive in environments where my design expertise is allowed to meet my imagination, allowing me to creatively change the way people work and help them better solve their every day hurdles. My experiences have placed me into unique opportunities to work on multi-disciplinary teams, centered around simulating at-scale and with a variety of collaborators and contributors.

## My Work
