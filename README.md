## About Me

*Personal Motto*: If it's not broken, break it, and then make it better.

*Goal*: I want to make HPC and Cloud Computing accessible and easy to use.

<br/>

I’m a Software Engineer and Architect/Designer by education with practical experience from both the areas of Computer Architecture and HPC. Through the use of simulation during my various experiences in graduate school and industry, I’ve come to appreciate the complexities of developing generalized workflow automation in the computational sciences. My experiences have instilled in me a deep passion for making high performance resources more readily useful and accessible to computational scientists, while also striving to make computational science more reproducible and document-able. These goals have lead me to create the Maestro Workflow Conductor, a lightweight tool for specifying and automating multi-step workflows on HPC resources, which has been used on many of the world’s fastest supercomputers (Summit, Sierra, Lassen, and others). I plan to continue to develop the philosophies, concepts, and software needed to provide computational scientists the tools and know-how they need to better design, develop, and communicate computational workflow process while also continuing to leverage opportunities to make these efforts easier to automate.

It is my firm belief that my goals are achievable by prioritizing sound Software Engineering and Design fundamentals. I love to build tools that users not only trust, but that allows them to more productively focus on their own work towards critical scientific progress; however, simply delivering a tool is not enough. Tools need to outlive singular projects requiring iterative design, modular components, and a clear vision for the future. I thrive in environments where my design expertise is allowed to meet my imagination, allowing me to creatively change the way people work and help them better solve their every day hurdles. My experiences have placed me into unique opportunities to work on multi-disciplinary teams, centered around simulating at-scale and with a variety of collaborators and contributors.
